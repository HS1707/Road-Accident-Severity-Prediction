# Road-Accident-Severity-Prediction-Cipher Hunters SEC37
# Aim
The aim of the Road Accident Severity Prediction project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the severity of road accidents. The model can then be used to provide drivers with early warnings and to help authorities identify and address road safety hotspots.

# Algorithm
# Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

1.1. Collect historical road accident data including features like weather conditions, road type, visibility, vehicle type, etc.

1.2. Preprocess the data:
   - Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal). 
# Step 2: Data Splitting
2.1. Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.

# Step 3: Model Training

3.1. Train a Decision Tree model:
   - Fit the Decision Tree algorithm on the training data.
   - Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., max depth, minimum samples per leaf) using cross-validation.

3.2. Train a Random Forest model:
   - Fit the Random Forest algorithm on the training data.
   - Tune hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, max depth of trees) through cross-validation.

3.3. Train a Logistic Regression model:
   - Fit the Logistic Regression algorithm on the training data.
   - Use techniques like regularization (e.g., L1 or L2) for model improvement.

3.4. Train a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) model:
   - Fit the k-NN algorithm on the training data.
   - Optimize the value of 'k' using cross-validation.

# Step 4: Model Evaluation

4.1. Evaluate the Decision Tree model:
   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix on the test set.

4.2. Evaluate the Random Forest model:
   - Use the same metrics as in 4.1 for evaluation.

4.3. Evaluate the Logistic Regression model:
   - Use the same metrics as in 4.1 for evaluation.

4.4. Evaluate the k-Nearest Neighbors model:
   - Use the same metrics as in 4.1 for evaluation.

# Step 5: Model Comparison and Selection

5.1. Compare the performance of the four models based on evaluation metrics.

5.2. Select the model with the highest overall performance as the final road accident severity prediction model.

# Step 6: Deployment

6.1. Deploy the selected model in a suitable environment for real-time predictions.

6.2. Set up a system to handle incoming data, preprocess it, and pass it through the selected model for predictions.

# Step 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

7.1. Monitor the model's performance in the deployed environment.

7.2. Regularly retrain the model with new data to ensure it remains accurate over time.

This algorithm provides a structured approach to building and deploying a road accident severity prediction system using four different machine learning models. 

# Building the Project 

1.Data Collection We began by sourcing accident data from reputable sources, including government databases and traffic safety organizations. This dataset included information on factors like weather conditions, road type, vehicle type, and more.

2.Data Preprocessing The raw data required extensive preprocessing. We cleaned missing values, standardized formats, and performed feature engineering to extract relevant information.

3.Feature Selection To enhance model performance, We conducted a thorough feature selection process. This involved statistical tests and correlation analysis to identify the most influential variables.

4.Model Selection After splitting the data into training and testing sets, We experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree,Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) and Logistic Regression. We evaluated their performance based on metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

5.Model Evaluation We fine-tuned the chosen model using techniques like cross-validation. This helped optimize hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

# Challenges Faced

1.Imbalanced Dataset: 
Dealing with imbalanced classes was a significant challenge. We employed techniques like oversampling and undersampling to address this issue.

2.Model Interpretability: 
Ensuring the model's predictions were interpretable was crucial. We used techniques like SHAP values and feature importance plots to explain the model's decisions.

# Future Improvements 
In the future, We plan to explore more advanced modeling techniques like ensemble methods and deep learning to further improve the accuracy of accident severity predictions.

# Conclusion 
This project has been a rewarding experience, allowing us to contribute to the important goal of road safety. We hope that the insights gained from this project will be instrumental in reducing the severity of accidents and ultimately saving lives.
