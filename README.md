# Road-Accident-Severity-Prediction
# Aim
The aim of the Road Accident Severity Prediction project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the severity of road accidents. The model can then be used to provide drivers with early warnings and to help authorities identify and address road safety hotspots.

# Algorithm
1.Randomly select a subset of the training data and a subset of the features.
2.Train a decision tree on the selected subset of data.
3.Repeat steps 1 and 2 for a large number of times, creating a forest of decision trees.
4.To make a prediction on a new data point, calculate the prediction of each decision tree in the forest and take the average
